In order to do this task I had used https://nf-co.re/chipseq/2.0.0 pipeline, which is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for Chromatin ImmunopreciPitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. In the first part the pipeline was run and then the assessment of the quality of the raw and processed data was done. The results were explored using genome browser IGV. At the end a segmentation tool was used to define chromatin states across the genome.
